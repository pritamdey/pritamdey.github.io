I am highly motivated to develop novel statistical methodology for complex structured data with great emphasis on real world application and computational performance. My current research projects as a postdoc include data analytic and methodological research on multi-omics data, spatial transtriptomics and generative AI. Previously, during my PhD, I worked on models for brain structural connectomes.

This page will soon contain a brief description for each of my research interest areas.
